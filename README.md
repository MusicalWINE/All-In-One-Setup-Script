# All-In-One Setup Script

#Introduction - I Suppose

This repository contain scripts to install the necessary software to run your favorite DAW for different Linux distrobutions. 
For now, the only supported distrobution is Arch Linux as that's the one I use and have access to at the moment. 

#Other Information

Just because this script is a good "do all" approach to this, that doesn't mean that I don't include the scripts it downloads and calls.
All scripts that are called and downloaded from the main script are also available as a "standalone" thing if you need it like that. 

#Getting Started - Finally...

If you're just looking for this, well, that's okay. 

Instructions:
Make sure you curl the right script for your distrobution!
Arch Linux: ```curl https://gitlab.com/winemusiccreation/all-in-one-setup-script/-/raw/main/Scripts/ArchLinux.sh --output ~/ArchLinux.sh && chmod +x ~/ArchLinux.sh && bash ~/ArchLinux.sh```

#Conclusion:
Some DAWs that are in this organization might require special configurating to get it jsut right. 
For example, Ableton Live 12 doens't show the ribbon that contains the "File" and "Options" button, but it can be fixed by pressing F11.
Ones like FLStudio seem to work pretty well already out of the box. Just the "Sound" panel is black for some reason when I go to it. 

Thank you and have fun!
